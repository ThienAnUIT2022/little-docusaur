# And... I'm another little Whale üêã

## About another me üåü

What do you think of the little whale above **(„Éª„Éª )?** Yeah, that‚Äôs a whale who studies and works, is quite serious and often worries about the future **(¬¥ÔΩ•·¥óÔΩ• `)**.
_Be careful, I‚Äôm going to talk a lot !_ **(‚òÜœâ‚òÜ)**
As for me **( ÀôÍí≥‚ÄãÀô )**, I‚Äôm a whale who swims in the clouds full of dreams, I pursue my passion and interests to nourish my soul **(„Å£ ÀòœâÀòœÇ )**. I like quiet and peaceful places **(¬¥Íí≥`)‚ô°**, away from crowded and noisy places **(Ôø£ Ôø£|||)**. I like to spend my days off at home cooking, making coffee, reading manga and listening to soft music **(¬¥,,‚Ä¢œâ‚Ä¢,,)‚ô°**.

## Hobbies üé®

### Photography üì∏

- I extremely love taking pictures **(‚âßœâ‚â¶)**! I take pictures not only to capture moments but also to show people how I see the world. My style is photos that have an "artistic" perspective or at least something special that I think is beautiful. Also, the colors in my photos are mostly warm and washed out, like 90s film. You can see my albums below **(>·¥ó‚Ä¢)**:

### Anime, Manga, Light Novel, Game üéÆ

- Hmmm, I read and watch a lot of Japanese anime, manga and light novels, my friend and someone call me "wibu" or "otaku" [(=^ÔΩ•œâÔΩ•^=)]. The games I play are usually games with similar art style to anime and manga including **Honkai Impact 3rd** (played the most), **Honkai Star Rail**, **Girl's Frontline 1 & 2**.

### Music üéµ

I listen to many different genres of music and usually according to the time of day or my mood. For example, according to the time, in the morning I will listen to dynamic Jazz like in coffee shops, in the afternoon I often listen to gentle Piano and in the evening it will be melodious, soulful Saxophone and Violin [(„Å£ ÀòœâÀòœÇ )]. Some singers that I like and listen to regularly are:

### Making coffee, cook and do crafts ‚òïüç≥‚úÇÔ∏è

- I can say that I drink coffee instead of water every day :b, because every morning when I wake up and in the evening I will drink a cup of coffee (2 cups/day), sometimes when I lack sleep I will drink more. I will not have a day of alertness without a drop of coffee that day **( ‚ïπ‚ñΩ‚ïπ )**.
- I'm not very good at cooking, but I enjoy the process of preparing, cooking and enjoying the food I make. I also often cook for my friends and am happy when they say it's delicious **(¬¥Íí≥`)‚ô°**.
- When I was young, I had a lot of free time and my mother had an Origami book so I folded them a lot **(Ôø£ ‚ñΩ Ôø£)„Çû**, gradually it became a hobby, whenever I had free time I would make them. I quite like regular polyhedra so I also found ways to make them for decoration, to make flower pots, to make desk calendars...etc. Besides, I like giving gifts to friends so I often make small gifts for them, sometimes I also wrap flowers myself.

_Well, Did you really read this far **Œ£( ¬∞ ‚ñ≥ ¬∞|||) ?** A-A-Are you interested in me **(‚ÅÑ ‚ÅÑ‚Ä¢‚ÅÑœâ‚ÅÑ‚Ä¢‚ÅÑ ‚ÅÑ)** Just kidding, ehehe :b. Anyway, thank you for taking the time to read this, have a nice day~._
